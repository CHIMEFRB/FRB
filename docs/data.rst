Overview
========

One purpose of this repository is to provide data
related to FRBs, their host galaxies, and the galaxies
foreground to them.  This includes measurements
(e.g. photometry), derived quantities (e.g. star formation
rate), and observational data (e.g. spectra).

Spectra
=======

SpecDB
------

As galaxy spectra related to FRB surveys becomes available,
we intend to archive these within a
`specdb <https://specdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
database file.

Here is the
`public specdb <https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Wx4ctpxHRDEI9joVzHGidtiO3spg5fb/view?usp=sharing>`_
which currently includes galaxy spectra related to
FRB 180924
`Bannister et al. 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Sci...365..565B/abstract>`_
and FRB 181112 (Prochaska et al. 2019).

You will need to:

#. Install `specdb <https://specdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
#. Place the above file in a folder
#. Point the environmental variable SPECDB to the folder
