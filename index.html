								<h3>Interests</h3>
                                My scientific interests are generally within
                                the field of galaxy formation and evolution. 
                                In particular, I use cosmic explosions such as
                                gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and quasars as tools
                                to study the dust, gas and metal content of 
                                intervening or host galaxy absorption systems.
                                This allows us to map the chemical enrichment of 
                                galaxies through cosmic time.
                                I am also actively involved in the search for and 
                                study of the electromagnetic counterparts associated with
                                gravitational wave events, such as merging
                                neutron stars and/or black holes. 
                                Finally, I am also currently working on fast radio bursts (FRBs), trying to disentangle the 
                                cosmic web in the intergalactic medium and constrain their progenitors through
                                population studies of their host galaxies.  
                                
                                 
                                See below for a list of the collaborations I am actively involved in
                                and the <a href="#publications" target="_blank">Publications</a> page for an overview 
                                of the published papers I have contributed to.

								<h3>Collaborations</h3> 
                                <b>Stargate (PI: Nial R. Tanvir)</b> 
                                is the continuation of the XS-GRB collaboration (sample paper published <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...623A..92S/abstract">here</a>),
                                now searching for the most exotic GRBs. We have access to almost all
                                instruments mounted at the four VLT unit telescopes, including several other
                                instruments mounted at smaller telescopes all over the world (such as the NOT).
                                The main science goals of this programme is to investigate and obtain follow-up
                                servations of high-redshift GRBs, short GRBs and otherwise peculiar
                                transients. <br>

                                founded collaboration, performing follow-up
                                observations of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources at
                                the Very Large Telescope detected by LIGO/Virgo (see webpage <a href="http://www.engrave-eso.org">here</a>). <br>

                                the optical counterparts and host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in addition to use 
                                FRBs as probes of the cosmic web. An overview of our main science goals and published can be found at <a href="http://ucolick.org/f-4">this</a>  webpage. <br>
